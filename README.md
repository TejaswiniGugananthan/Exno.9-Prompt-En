## Aim: 
To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Algorithm:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure

### 1. Define the Content Type
The first step is to identify the target format of content, which could be:

a. A formal report (e.g., on the impact of artificial intelligence in education)

b. An informative article (e.g., discussing the rise of renewable energy)

c. A case study (e.g., exploring AI adoption in the retail sector)

d. A creative story or script (e.g., a fictional narrative for a graphic novel or short film)

### 2. Select Appropriate Prompt Patterns
Apply diverse prompting strategies to guide content generation. These techniques include:

### Query Decomposition
This involves breaking a broad content request into manageable sub-questions. For example, instead of prompting “Write a report on AI in education,” decompose it into parts such as:

a. What are the current applications of AI in education?

b. How has AI improved learning outcomes?

c. What are the challenges and ethical concerns?

d. This ensures that the AI covers all necessary angles comprehensively.

### Decision-Making Prompts
In this pattern, the prompt incorporates options that guide the AI’s response. For instance:

a. “Write an article in a journalistic tone or a conversational tone. Choose the one that best suits a general audience.”

b. “Should this case study be data-driven or anecdotal? Use the selected approach to write the opening section.”

This allows for greater control over tone, depth, and structure.

### Semantic Filtering
This technique involves using semantically rich instructions to focus the AI's response on certain values, facts, or sentiments. For example:

a. “Generate a report that emphasizes sustainability and long-term economic impact.”

b. “Ensure the article conveys optimism about technological progress.”

Such prompts refine the alignment of content with desired themes or sentiments.

### Style Transfer Prompts
These prompts guide the AI to adopt a specific writing style or mimic a known author, publication, or format. For example:

a. “Write a case study in the style of a Harvard Business Review article.”

b. “Create a comic book narrative inspired by Marvel’s storytelling approach.”

### Iterative Refinement Prompts
Use follow-up prompts to review and improve the content. For instance:

a. “Revise the introduction to be more engaging for teenage readers.”

b. “Add three more examples to support the argument in paragraph two.”

This promotes incremental enhancement of the initial output.

### Implementation Example

a. Use Case: Creating an Article on Renewable Energy Trends

### Initial Simple Prompt:
a. "Write an article on renewable energy."

### Decomposed Prompt Structure:

a. What are the main sources of renewable energy today?

b. What trends have emerged over the last five years?

c. Which countries are leading in renewable energy adoption?

d. What are the expected technological advancements in this field?

### Decision-Making Prompt:
a. “Write this article for an audience of undergraduate science students in an informative and semi-formal tone.”

### Refinement Prompt:
a. “Add a case study of a country that transitioned to 50% renewable energy and discuss the challenges faced.”

### Style Transfer Prompt:
a. “Format the article like a National Geographic piece, using vivid descriptions and data-supported claims.”

## Result :  
The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
